## What Happens Next: Story 6+ (Node-Based Visual Editor)

### Planning Documents Ready
- ✅ `MARY_NODE_BASED_UI_PLANNING.md` - Strategic analysis
- ✅ `MARY_STORY5_PLANNING.md` - Original split-screen planning

### Proposed Story 6 Breakdown (8 stories, 20-26 hours)

**Phase 1: MVP (Stories 6.1-6.3) - 6-8 hours**
- Story 6.1: Core SceneNode component
- Story 6.2: Node graph layout by chapter (React Flow)
- Story 6.3: Node interactions (click, hover)

**Phase 2: UX Polish (Stories 6.4-6.6) - 8-10 hours**
- Story 6.4: Drag & drop reordering
- Story 6.5: Character visualization
- Story 6.6: Status visualization & filtering

**Phase 3: Advanced (Stories 6.7-6.8) - 6-8 hours**
- Story 6.7: Zoom & pan controls
- Story 6.8: Chapter tabs & navigation

## Key Recommendations

1. **Node Type**: Chapter-centric (each node = one chapter, expandable to scenes)
2. **Technology**: React Flow - purpose-built for node-based editors
3. **Duration**: 20-26 hours (3-4 days of development)

## Decision Point: What's Next?

Ready for your input:
1. Should we implement Story 6 (Node-Based UI)?
2. Or focus on alternative features (export, history, collaboration)?
3. Or stabilization/testing before adding more?
